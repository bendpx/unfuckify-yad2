This braindead Greasemonkey script adds a few much needed features to yad2.co.il - the place Israelis with no facebook friends go to look for apartments in Tel Aviv:
* Removes a crapton of distracting garbage
* Colors ads according to how many times you viewed them
* Lets you downvote an apartment so you don't have to look at it again
